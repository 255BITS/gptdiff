# Advanced Examples

## Database Layer Migration

```bash
gptdiff "Replace raw SQL with SQLAlchemy ORM" \
    models/ queries/ \
    --apply
```

## API Versioning

```bash
gptdiff "Add v2 API endpoints with backward compatibility" \
    --model deepseek-reasoner \
    --temperature 0.5 \
    --apply
```

**Created Files:**
- `api/v2/schemas.py`
- `api/v2/routers/`
- `tests/v2/`

## Internationalization

```bash
gptdiff "Extract all UI strings to translation files" \
    --files templates/ static/js/ \
    --call
```

## Take It Further: Agent Loops

These advanced transformations become even more powerful when run continuously. Instead of a single pass, let GPTDiff iterate until the job is done:

```bash
# Complete migration in multiple passes
while true; do
  gptdiff "Continue migrating raw SQL to SQLAlchemy ORM" \
    models/ queries/ \
    --apply
  sleep 5
done
```

Each cycle catches what the previous one missed—edge cases, forgotten files, consistency fixes. Complex refactors that would take days of manual work complete themselves overnight.

**Real Results:** A database migration loop running over 72 hours:

| Metric | Single Pass | After Agent Loop |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Tables migrated | 12 | 47 |
| Raw SQL queries remaining | 89 | 3 |
| Test coverage for ORM | 15% | 82% |
