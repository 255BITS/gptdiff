Alright, I need to apply the given diff to the "design-philosophy.md" file. Let me start by carefully examining the original content and the diff.

The original Core Tenets list has four items. The diff removes the second and third items ("Idempotence by Design" and "Context Preservation") and renumbers the fourth item as the second.

First, I'll identify the lines to be removed: lines starting with "2." and "3.". Then, the fourth item ("4. Progressive Simplification") needs to become "2." since the previous two items are removed. 

I'll go through each line of the original content. The first tenet remains the same. The second and third lines are marked with a minus in the diff, so they should be deleted. The fourth line is modified by changing "4." to "2." and keeping the rest. 

So, after removing the two lines and adjusting the numbering of the last item, the Core Tenets section will have two items: Radical Essentialism and Progressive Simplification. 

I need to ensure that only the specified lines are changed and that the surrounding context remains intact. The "Primary Constraint" section below stays as it is. 

Let me reconstruct the modified section:

1. **Radical Essentialism** - Only what's absolutely necessary survives
2. **Progressive Simplification** - Each change reduces complexity

That's it. The rest of the file remains unchanged. I'll make sure there are no extra spaces or unintended modifications.
