# Quickstart Guide

Get GPTDiff running in under 2 minutes.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install gptdiff
```

## Step 2: Configure

Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api), then set it:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export GPTDIFF_LLM_API_KEY='your-api-key'

# Windows
set GPTDIFF_LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Step 3: Your First Transformation

Navigate to any project and describe the change you want:

```bash
cd your-project
gptdiff "Add type hints to all functions" --apply
```

**What happens:**
1. GPTDiff scans your project files (respecting `.gitignore`)
2. Sends the code + your instruction to an AI model
3. Receives a unified diff with the requested changes
4. Applies the diff to your files

**Expected output:**
```
Reading project files...
Generating diff with gemini-3-pro-preview...
Applying changes...
✅ Successfully applied patch to 3 files
```

**Tip:** The default model (`gemini-3-pro-preview`) works great for most tasks. For very simple changes, use a faster model:
```bash
gptdiff "Fix typos in comments" --model gemini-2.0-flash --apply
```

## Step 4: Review and Commit

GPTDiff modifies your files directly. Use Git to review and manage changes:

```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# Stage changes interactively (review each change)
git add -p

# Commit the changes you want
git commit -m "Add type hints"

# Or discard all changes if needed
git checkout .
```

## Three Usage Modes

| Command | Behavior | When to Use |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `gptdiff "prompt"` | Creates `prompt.txt` only | Preview what will be sent to AI |
| `gptdiff "prompt" --call` | Creates `diff.patch` | Review diff before applying |
| `gptdiff "prompt" --apply` | Applies changes directly | Ready to modify files |

**Example: Preview before applying**
```bash
# First, generate and review the diff
gptdiff "Refactor to async/await" --call
cat diff.patch  # Review the changes

# If it looks good, apply it
gptpatch diff.patch
```

## Step 5: Run Continuously (Agent Loops)

GPTDiff becomes even more powerful when you run it in a loop. Instead of making one change at a time, let it continuously improve your codebase:

```bash
while true; do
  gptdiff "Add missing test cases for edge conditions" --apply
  sleep 5
done
```

Each cycle finds the next improvement opportunity, applies it, and continues. **Real example:** One overnight test coverage run went from 18 to 127 test cases—7x improvement with zero manual effort.

**Popular agent loop use cases:**

| Goal | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Expand test coverage | "Add missing test cases for edge conditions" |
| Reduce tech debt | "Refactor functions with high complexity" |
| Fix security issues | "Find and fix OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities" |
| Sync documentation | "Update docs to match implementation" |

For detailed automation patterns, see the [Agent Loops Guide](examples/automation.md).

## Tips for Success

- **Start small**: Test with a focused change before attempting large refactors
- **Review first**: Use `--call` to preview changes before applying
- **Target specific files**: For large codebases, specify directories to reduce context:
  ```bash
  gptdiff "Add logging" src/api/ src/utils/
  ```
- **Expect timing variance**: Complex changes may take 30-60 seconds depending on the model
- **Always review**: AI-generated code should be checked, especially for error handling and edge cases
- **Scale up with loops**: Once you're comfortable, run GPTDiff overnight—one user went from 18 to 127 test cases in 8 hours
